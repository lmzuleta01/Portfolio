<h1>Hi, I'm Leandro! <br/> Data Analyst | Python Developer | RF & Electrical Engineer </h1>

<h2> ⭐ Featured Project (SQL + Python + Power BI):</h2>

- <b> [Bank Churn Anaylsis (94% Accuracy)](https://github.com/lmzuleta01/Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-Analysis) </b>

  - Built a full end-to-end churn prediction pipeline using SQL for data storage, Python for feature engineering and model training, and Power BI for interactive visualizations. Identified key behavioral drivers of churn and trained a Random Forest model for prediction.

<h2>👨‍💻 Data Analytics Projects:</h2>

- <b>[Automobile Anaylsis Project — Practicing EDA in Python](https://github.com/lmzuleta01/Automobile-Anaylsis-Project) </b>
  - Performed exploratory data analysis on vehicle pricing data to uncover relationships between engine size, fuel efficiency, brand, and market price using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
  
- <b>[Highest Paid Athletes Dataset — Creating Visualizations for Key Finding](https://github.com/lmzuleta01/EDA-Highest-Paid-Athletes-Dataset)  </b>
  - Analyzed global athlete earnings and developed visualizations to highlight trends in salary distribution, sport categories, nationality representation, and revenue streams.

<h2>⚙️ Machine Learning Projects:</h2>

- <b>[Amazon Review Insight — NLP with spaCy](https://github.com/lmzuleta01/Amazon-Review-Insight) </b>
  - Applied natural language processing techniques (tokenization, lemmatization, sentiment patterns) using spaCy to examine customer reviews and extract themes influencing product satisfaction.
    
- <b> [USArrests Dataset — PCA & Clustering](https://github.com/lmzuleta01/PCA-Clustering-on-USArrests-Dataset) </b>
  - Used Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality of crime statistics across U.S. states and performed clustering to identify regional crime patterns and similarities
